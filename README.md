A place for the intersection of design, color science, and software engineering.

This integrates code from Material Color Utilities (n√©e libmonet), a Google library for color
science that serves as the foundation of Material You's theming.

Any code here is provided without warranty or license, its a grab bag of code covered by the 
Material Color Utilities library, and its blurry as to when I'm acting as an individual or a Google
employee when talking color science externally.
